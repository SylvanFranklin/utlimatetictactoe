# UVM CS1210 Final Project 
`Dylan Pizura and Sylvan Franklin`

#### Dependencies
- python standard library `random`, `typing`, `enum`
- unix terminal emulator with ANSI rendering for color codes

#### Run instructions
The game will prompt you on whether you want to play against another player or play against a random AI. It will then ask you to make a move on a grid via a coordinate (1-9), numbered right to left. If you are unfamiliar with the rules of ultimate tic tac toe I recommend watching a short youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_Na3a1ZrX7c). But the basic rules are as follows:


1. Player one makes a move on one of nine smaller boards.
2. Player two makes a move on the corresponding big board.
3. Repeat steps **1** and **2** until a board is won.
4. When three boards in a row are won, the game is over. 

In the event that a board is full you may choose to move anywhere.
